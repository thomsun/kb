1. Find mid of the linked list
    - Create 2 pointers - slow and fast - slow moves 1 node and fast moves 2 nodes
    - Start slow and fast at head
    - Keep moving fast and slow if fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null
    - The mid is at slow one - Note that the slow is the greater one e.g. if there are 3 elements the mid one is at the 2nd element

1. Reverse linked list
    - [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
        - Given head of linked list, reverse the linked list
        - The trick is having 3 pointers - prevHead, head, and headNext/temp
        - Keep moving head, for each head
            - Save head.next to headNext/temp
            - Make head.next point to prevHead - This is to reverse the pointer
            - Move prevHead -> head
            - Move head -> headNext/temp that we saved earlier

1. Dummy node as pre head
    - [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
        - Given 2 sorted linked lists, merge them into 1 sorted linked list
        - Create a dummy node for easy code; otherwise, we need to check null case
        - Make current pointer at the dummy node
        - Point the current.next point to the min one - either list1 or list2 - and move that one to the next
        - Move current to current.next
        - Like merge sort, there could be either list1 or list2 left, make current.next point to the non-null one
        - Finally, the root is at dummy.next

    - [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)
        - Give a linked list, reorder them by `0 -> n -> 1 -> n-1 -> 2 -> n-2 ...`
        - The trick is to break half of the list and reverse it; find mid and reverse
        - To merge 2 lists, it's similar to the question above.
        - Create a dummy node and create a current starting at the dummy
        - Add list1 and if list2 is not null add list2 as well, given that list2 is shorter or equal to list1 at max

    - [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
        - Given a linked list and `n`, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list
        - Create a dummy node
        - Start `slow` and `fast` at the dummy node
        - Move `fast` for `n` times
        - Then, move both `slow` and `fast` at the same time until `fast` reaches the end
        - `slow` should be 'before' the target node; `slow.next = slow.next.next`

1. Deep copy linked list with random pointer
    - [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)
        - Given a head to special linked list that has `next` and `random` pointer, return head of a deep copy linked list
        - The trick is to make sure not to recreate the node that we already copied by saving in a map of old node -> new node
        - Keep traversing and copying; there are 2 ways
            - My way 
                - Get or Clone `current` (next pointer) and `random`
                - Point `newCurrent.random` to `newRandom`
                - Move pointer to both original and clone one using `next` pointer path
            - NeetCode way 
                - Clone all of the original ones and save in the map
                - Go through the original one again, now we have all the clones one in the map, link them
                - The new head will be `map.get(head)`

1. Number operations in linked list
    - [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
        - Given 2 linked lists containing digits in reverse order, return a new linked list containing the sum of the 2
        - `2 -> 4 -> 3` and `5 -> 6 -> 4` return `7 -> 0 -> 8` because 342 + 465 = 807
        - Since the lists are in reverse order, we can calculate from head
        - The trick is 
            - Don't forget the carry number; it can be the last one that we need to create
            - Simple idea is to have 3 loops - both not null, remainder list, and carry. We could merge them in to 1 loop by keep doing if `l1` not null || `l2` not null || carry > 0, and inside the loop make null value as 0 so the calculation stays the same

1. Linked list problem in an array form
    - [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
        - Given an array size `n+1` containing number between 1-n, find duplicate number; there is only one duplicate number
        - This is linked list problem where you can jump to the next index starting from index 0
        - The trick is the duplicate number creates loop and we need to find the start of the loop
        - The way to find the start of the loop is do 2 steps
            - Do slow/fast pointer to stop when the loop is detected
            - Create another pointer starting at head i.e. index 0; move it along with the slow pointer; when both meet that's where the loop start
