1. Basic Stack usage
    - [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
    - [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

1. FIFO property can be helpful
    - [155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
        - Implement a stack that can also return min value
        - The trick is the top value saw all the elements in the past so attaching min value so far with the element help returning min at O(n)

1. Monotonic Stack
    - [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)
        - Given an array of temperatures, return number of days have to wait for warmer temperatures
        - Use monotonic stack to keep track of position `i`
        - Add data backward, pop the day that has lower or equal temperature. So, the bottom of the stack is the warmest day
        - The diff of the index will be the number of wait days

    - [853. Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)
        - Given an array of positions and speeds of cars and target distance, return the number of car fleet.
        - The rule is if one car reach the other in front, they will merge into one. The fleet's speed will be the one in front i.e. the slower one
        - To know if cars will be merged or not, we need to calculate time each car reaching the destination. Faster car has lower amount of time
        - Also, we need to sort the car by position
        - Use the monotonic stack to kee track of time. The car that has lower time i.e. faster car will be removed as it will be merged with the slower one
        - The result will be the size of the stack

    - [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)
        - Given an array of heights of histogram, returns the largest rectangle
        - If the height of the current bar is lower than the previous, the current bar will block the size of the rectangle
        - Use the stack to keep track of increasing heights only. Pop out all the one that are taller than the current one
        - The logic to calculate rectangle could be complicated. Need to read the solution again.
