1. One forward, the other backward
    - Move 2 pointers to meet the condition in the same loop
        - Move the pointer to point to the letter - [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
        - Move left pointer to increase sum; move right pointer to decrease sum - [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

1. Sort data first would help running pointer more meaningful
    - [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) - Sort data, for each element search the other 2 using 2 pointers, skip duplicate for better performance

1. Getting max value along the way
    - [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) - Keep calculating amount of water from outside to inside, move the pointer with shorter value inside, update max value
    - [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) - Keep track of max left and right, the water amount added = max - current on the smaller size, move the pointer on the smaller size.
