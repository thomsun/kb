1. Basic binary search
    - Remember the loop
    ```java
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // mid at size/2 round down
            if (nums[mid] == target) 
                return mid;
            if (nums[mid] < target) 
                start = mid + 1;
            else
                end = mid - 1;
        }
    ```

        - Items sorted and arranged in 2D matrix
        - Stretch it out as 1D by having a formula to map mid point to row/col

1. It can help brute forcing solution
    - [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
        - Given a array of banana pile and `h` as no. of hour til guard is back, return mininum no. of banana per hour `k` that Koko can eat all the piles before the guard is back
        - The slowest speed is 1 per hour
        - The fastest speed is the max of banana pile i.e. Koko will spend time eating equal to number of piles 
        - We keep searching for the slowest speed
        - Have a function to calculate hour spent if Koko eat at `k` speed
        - Use binary search to scope the speed down

1. Fancy ways to cut data in half
    - [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
        - Given a sorted array that was rotated, return the min number
        - The trick is how to know which side to keep left or right?
        - If the 'crack' is on the left i.e. mid < right, search left -> mid
        - If the 'crack' is on the right i.e. mid > right, search mid + 1 -> right
        - Search until left == right i.e. the bottom of the crack
    - [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
        - Given a sorted array that was rotated, search index of the `target` value using binary search
        - The trick is how to know which side to keep left or right? Same as above
        - If 'crack' is on the left i.e. mid < right
            - If mid < target < right i.e. target is in the slope from mid to right -> search mid+1 -> right
            - Else i.e. target is in the crack side -> search left -> mid-1
        - If 'crack' is on the right i.e. mid > right
            - If left < target < mid i.e. target is in the slop from left to mid -> search left -> mid-1
            - Else i.e. target is in the crack side -> search mid+1 -> right
    - [658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)
        - Given a sorted array `arr[]`, returns a subarray size `k` that minimum sum of the 'distance' to `x` i.e. `|arr[i] - x|` 
        - For example 
            - Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3` 
            - Output: `[1,2,3,4]`
        - The trick is to use binary search to adjust the window
        - If the distance of `mid` > the distance of `mid+k` -> left = mid+1;
        - Else -> right = mid
        - The answer is array from `arr[left]` - `arr[left+k]`
