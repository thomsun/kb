1. Use `HashMap` or `HashSet` to count/remember elements
    - [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
    - [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

1. While collecting data, we can calculate/check the element as well
    - [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

1. Smart way to hash
    - Use `char[] hash` that count frequency as hash string: [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
    - Use string concat to create meaningful hash: [36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)
    - Use string length + separator to seperate words: [271. Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/) or [659 Â· Encode and Decode Strings](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/659/)

1. Multiple iterations 
    - Forward and backward: [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)
    - Use hashing with determistic sequence to search data: [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
