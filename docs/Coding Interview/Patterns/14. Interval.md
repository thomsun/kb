1. Check overlapping intervals
    - Use negative logic is easier to understand
    - 2 intervals are NOT overlapping if 
        - End of the first < Start of the second `<--1-->     <--2-->`  OR
        - End of the second < Start of the first `<--2-->     <--1-->`
    - So 2 intervals are touching/overlapping if the above condition is not true
```java
    boolean overlapping(Interval interval1, Interval interval2) {
        return !(interval1.start() < interval2.end() || interval2.start() < interval1.end());
    }
```

1. Sorted intervals by start time helps a lot
    - [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/submissions/)
        - Given intervals sorted by start time and a new interval to insert, insert the new interval and merge with the existing one
        - There are 3 possible sections 
            - Intervals that are not overlapping with the new interval and the start time is before
            - Intervals that are overlapping with the new interval
            - Intervals that are not overlapping with the new interval and the start time is after
        - Best to deal with them in 3 section separately
        - The first section, add the interval to the answer list directly until the interval is overlapping
        - The second section, keep merging until the interval is not overlapping; then add the merge result to the answer list
        - The last section, add the interval to the answer list directly until the end of the data
        - Be careful the edge case where the interval array is empty but the new interval is not
