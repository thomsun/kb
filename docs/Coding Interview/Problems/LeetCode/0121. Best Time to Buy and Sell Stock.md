## Problem
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```
 
Constraints:
```
    1 <= prices.length <= 105
    0 <= prices[i] <= 104
```

## Approaches
- The max profit would be from "somewhat" min and max price day
- We can only gain the profit only if the min is on the day before the max
- Brute force solution
  - Pick a buy date `i` from `0` -> `n - 2`. Last day can't be buy date.
  - Let's `j` is a date after `i` i.e. from `i+1` -> `n-1`. Calculate and get max of `prices[j] - price[i]`
  - O(n^2)
- Where to optimize?
  - Consider DP approach where `DP(i)` = max profit of day `i`
  - Max profit of day `i` can be either 
    - The max profit of day `i-1` i.e. the price at day `i` is not high enough to create new max profit
    - OR ... the price at day `i` can create new max profit i.e. `prices[i]` - min price so far > current max profit
  - If we go left to right, the history that matters is 
    - The min price as this is the 'best' buy date
    - The max profit as to keep track of the answer
  - This way we can go through the prices only once

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (int p : prices) {
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, p - min);
            min = Math.min(min, p);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
