## Problem
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```
 
Constraints:
```
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
```
 

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Approaches
- This can be really headache to think than it should be
- Imagine we have a 'chain' of numbers that can be summed to a number.
- When should we include `nums[i]` in the chain? When the previous change + `nums[i]` is better
- We can use dynamic programming approach. Let `dp[i]` is the max sequence til `nums[i]`
- `dp[i]` is the max of
  - `dp[i-1]` -> `nums[i]` is not included
  - max sequence ends at `i-1` + `nums[i]` -> `nums[i]` is included with the adjacent sequence
  - `nums[i]` -> `nums[i]` over power the previously found so far
- We can pull the last 2 which is the problem of finding the 'max sequence end at `i`' as the main problem itself and the total max can be just the max of sequenc ends at `i` for all `i`
- So, finally, we can let `dp[i]` is the max sequence that ends at index `i`
  - for all `i`
    - `dp[i]` is max between `dp[i-1] + nums[i]` and `nums[i]`
    - `answer` is the max of all `dp[i]`
- Since DP here is using just previous value so we don't need a full array for this

## Solution

class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int dp = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            dp = Math.max(dp + n, n);
            result = Math.max(result, dp);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
