## Problem
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```
 

Constraints:
```
    2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
    The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
```
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Approaches
- The brute force approach would be for each `nums[i]` calculating the product by going through the nums again. This approach is O(n^2)
- What we can better is to save the product value to be reused
- Consider, the `answer[i]` is the product of `nums[0]` - `nums[i-1]` x the product of `nums[i+1]` - `nums[n-1]`
```
  <- product before -> i <- product after ->
```
- Looping forward, we can get the product til `i` so we can get the 'product before' part
- Looping backward then would give us the 'product after'
- We can combine the two to get the answer
- For example
```
nums                          [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
Forward                       [ *, 1, 2, 6]
Backward                      [24,12, 4, *]
Answer = Forward x Backward = [24,12, 8, 6]

Need to init * as 1 so we can multiple them all
```

- The approach uses 3 arrays so space is O(3n)
- To reduce this we can do in place calculation in the answer array itself
- For the forward loop, we can still do the same
```
nums                          [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
Answer                        [ *, 1, 2, 6]
```
- For the backward loop, we need to keep track of the total product so far because we don't have extra array to save
- Let's have `right` var to keep track of the total product backward. Then we can update the answer array by multiply `answer[i]` with `right`
```
nums                          [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
Answer                        [ *, 1, 2, 6]
right                          24,12, 4, *  
Answer                        [24,12, 8, 6]
```

## Solution
```java
// O(n) space solution
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] forward = new int[nums.length];
        int[] backward = new int[nums.length];
        int[] answer = new int[nums.length];

        forward[0] = backward[nums.length - 1] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            forward[i] = forward[i-1] * nums[i-1];
        }

        for (int i=nums.length-2; i>=0; i--) {
            backward[i] = backward[i+1] * nums[i+1];
        }

        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            answer[i] = forward[i] * backward[i];
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
```java
// O(1) space solution
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] answer = new int[nums.length];

        answer[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1; i<nums.length; i++) {
            answer[i] = answer[i-1] * nums[i-1];
        }

        int right = 1;
        for (int i=nums.length-2; i>=0; i--) {
            right *= nums[i+1];
            answer[i] *= right;
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```
