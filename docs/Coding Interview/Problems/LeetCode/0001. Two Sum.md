## Problem
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    }
}
```

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
 

Constraints:
```
    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.
```
 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

## Approaches

Brute force approach

- For `nums[i]`, go through all other elements `nums[j]` if `nums[i]` + `nums[j]` == target
- This is O(n^2) solution

Idea improve
- We want to find `target - nums[i]` value quickly
- We can use Set or Map to collect data so checking if `target - nums[i]` exists can be O(n). This will make the whole solution O(n)
- Simple approach is to
  - Go through `nums` to collect data with position in a Map
  - Go through `nums` again to find the match from the Map previously created
- However, we could go through `nums` in one go by checking the target then add to the Map
```
index                                   i
nums[] = { <nums already saved in Map>, X, <nums not parsing yet>}

if target - X is in the Map
    return { position of 'target - X', i}
else
    Map.put(X, i)
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            Integer pos = map.get(target - nums[i]);
            if (pos != null) {
                return new int[] {pos, i};
            } 
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        // This shouldn't happen
        return null;
    }
}
```
