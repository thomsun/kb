## Problem
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```
 

Constraints:
```
    0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```

## Approach
### Union Find
- The ask is to have `O(n)` run time so this is going to be parsing through the array
- The number in the consecutive sequence can be in any order. So to answer if adding number `nums[i]` would increase any previos sequence or not we need to store pretty much all the sequence so far. 
- The previous sequence could be as short as 1 so using DP to save something like 'max so far' would not work here
- The problem her is like a grouping. See

```
      < seq 1>    <--- seq 2 ---> ... <--- seq n --->                
  Adding X, would X 
      1) Join any existing sequence?
         1.1) If so, does X join 2 sequences to be 1 single sequence?
      2) Or, X can't join any sequence and create a new one?
```
- Naively we could save 'ranges' of the sequences so far and check if X can join any of them or not
- A better way is to use 'Union Find' to join them together
- The algorithm is following
    - Create a `Map<Integer, Integer>` that maps num to parent
    - For `nums[i]`, create a new entry and make the number as its own parent
    - If there is `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i]+1` in the map, update their parent to be `nums[i]`
    - This will join the 'tree' of consecutive number together using the latest number as new root

### Counting
- The previous approach is generic in the sense that it can be used to group any thing
- Since this problem can be grouped by consecutive number, we can just rely on math to find/connect groups
- We can have a `Map<Integer, Boolean>` to track what number we seen has been already count
- For `nums[i]`, we count forward and backward. We flip the flag when counting so we don't count them again.
- Note that I thought of using `Set` instead but removing element from a `Set` while iterating can cause an exception

## Solution
```java
// Basic Union Find
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int n : nums) {
            map.put(n, n);
            if (map.containsKey(n - 1)) {
                int root = findRoot(n - 1, map);
                map.put(root, n);
            }
            if (map.containsKey(n + 1)) {
                int root = findRoot(n - 1, map);
                map.put(root, n);
            }
        }

        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int n : map.keySet()) {
            int root = findRoot(n, map);
            int countSoFar = count.getOrDefault(root, 0) + 1;
            count.put(root, countSoFar);
            result = Math.max(result, countSoFar);
        }
        return result;
    }       

    public int findRoot(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        int root = map.get(n);
        while (root != n) {
            root = map.get(n);
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

```java
// Counting
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2) return nums.length;

        Map<Integer, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (map.containsKey(n)) continue;
            map.put(n, false);
        }

        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (map.get(n)) continue;

            map.put(n, true);
            int count = 1;
            int i = n - 1;
            while (map.containsKey(i)) {
                map.put(i, true);
                i--;
                count++;
            }
            i = n + 1;
            while (map.containsKey(i)) {
                map.put(i, true);
                i++;
                count++;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, count);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
