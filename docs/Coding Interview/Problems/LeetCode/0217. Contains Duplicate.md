## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```
 
Constraints:
```
    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```

## Approaches
- We need a 'tally marks' that keep tracks of appearance
- Since the requirement is just 'at least twice', we don't need to actually count. We could just do 'seen' and 'unseen' - 2 states. Using `Set<Integer>` would be enough
- And the requirement is to return boolean, no need to collect all the 'non-distinct' values, we can short cut returning true once we run into an already 'seen' one
- We can go through the list
  - If seen, return true
  - If not seen, add the number into the Set
- One trick for Set in java is `add()` method return true if this set did not already contain the specified element. So we can shorten the code a little bit.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<Integer>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!seen.add(num)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
} 
```
