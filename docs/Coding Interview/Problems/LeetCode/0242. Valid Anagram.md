## Problem
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
 

Constraints:
```
    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
    s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
```

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## Approaches
- `s` is an anagram of `t` if `s` has same frequency/count of character exactly same as that of `t`
- We can do 'tally marks' of `s` in a `Map<Character, Integer>`
- Next, we go through each character in `t` and 'unmark'
- If there is a char in `t` that missing in the 'tally marks' OR there is any character left in the 'tally marks' then `s` is not an anagram of `t`
- Using `Map<Character, Integer>` should be able to handle unicode. Otherwise, an array of `int[]` covering all know char i.e. size = 26 to cover all lower case here should be enough

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            if (!count.containsKey(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            int freq = count.get(c) - 1;
            if (freq == 0) {
                count.remove(c);
            } else {
                count.put(c, freq);
            }
        }
        return count.size() == 0;
    }
}
```
