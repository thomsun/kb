## Problem
The system needs a globally unique ID

## Solution
1. Database's auto increment
    - Pros: Easy to implement for a single server
    - Cons: Hard to scale with multiple DB servers. May be able to do odd/even but doesn't scale well

1. UUID
    - Pros: Easy to implement; Hard to have collision
    - Cons: Can't use ID to sort; UUID is long (16 chars - 128 bits)

1. Ticket Server
    - Pros: Easy to implement; Numeric/Sortable
    - Cons: Single point of failure; Hard to scale

1. Twitter snowflake

The trick is to break 64 bits into sections - timestamp|data center ID|server ID|sequence number
    - Sign bit (1 bit) - Always 0. Reserved for signed/unsigned cases in the future
    - Timestamp (41 bits) - Covers around 70 years. Use custom epoch
    - Data center ID (5 bits) - Covers 32 data centers
    - Machine ID (5 bits) - Covers 32 servers / data centers
    - Sequence Number (12 bits) - Covers 4k / second


    - Pros: Numeric/Sortable; Scalable as we can have multiple ID generating servers
    - Cons: Hard to implement; Clock synchronization

1. Key Generator Server

The trick is to pre-generate unique keys and save them in the database to make sure to key reuse.
The key can be numbers or unique string. 

    - Pros: Can cache/preload into the server with specific range that needs the key; The key can be 'returned/recycled'
    - Cons: Single point of failure; Need a replica; Needs a lot of space to store all possible keys

 ## Usage
    - Tiny URL - Convert ID to String using base 62 (0-9, a-b, A-Z)
