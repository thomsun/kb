## Problem
Design newsfeed where users can see posts that the user follows. Posts can also contains photos, video, likes, etc.

## Key Requirements
- Functional
    - Users can post content including photos, video
    - Users can get news feed in reverse chronological order
    - Users can see friends posts (people/pages that the user follow) in the feed
- Non-Functional
    - Read > Write
    - Availability, Latency > Consistency

## Key Design Point
- Get feed quickly
    - Generate feed offline - Have a dedicate service that generate feed for each user in memory
    - LRU for cache policy
    - Adjust cache size i.e. number of posts in cache per user behavior
    - This cache can be partitioned by user id, ultimately consistent hashing
- Push a post to followers
    - Pull or Fanout on read
        - Newsfeed is generated during read time
        - Save resources; no hot key problem on the user who has a lot of followers
        - Hard to find a right cadance
    - Push or Fanout on write
        - Newsfeed is generated durint write time i.e. the follower' cache is updated immediately
        - Followers get post near realtime
        - Hot key problem on the celebrity
    - Hybrid
        - Push for majority of users. Pull for celebrity.
    - Another approach could be push only for online users; Need web sockets keep tracking online users

- Feed ranking
    - Bottom line is the creation time but it can include other factor as well
    - It's better to make a separate service


## Solution
- API
    - publishPost - This is simple; just post the content
    - getFeed - The API should accept from/to. The size of the feed per page can depend on client type (mobile vs desktop)
- Storage design
    - Relational DB for Users/Entity/Relationship as they have clear relationship; GraphDB can be used as well
    - Relational DB for Posts
    - S3 for media contents
