# Theme

This is custom theme I made myself. 

- Download the file [here](../tmux_theme.sh)
- Rename the file to `.tmux_theme.sh`
- Move the file to home directory (`~`)
- Make sure you turn execution flag on. 
    ```
    chmod +x ~/.tmux_theme.sh
    ```
- Configure in `~/.tmux.conf` as following
    ```
    # Custom theme
    run -b '~/.tmux_theme.sh'
    ```
