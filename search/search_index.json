Installation Prerequisite MkDocs requires python 3 and pip. See installation details here I have python2 installed by default so I install python3 using Homebrew that comes with pip3 brew install python3 Verify python and pip version $ python3 --version Python 3 .9.2 $ pip3 --version pip 21 .0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip ( python 3 .9 ) Installing MkDocs pip3 install mkdocs Themes and Plugins Themes mkdocs-material - Material theme for MkDocs Plugins mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin - Plugin to pull and display git update timestamp on the page Publishing Publish to github pages GitHub Pages provide documentation hosting for free. There are 2 options - Organization/User site and Project site. Organization/User site is to host documentation at .github.io, while Project site is to host documentation at .github.io/ .
